# **Image-to-Asymptote Model Fine-Tuning**

## **Overview**

Develop a fine-tuned version of an open-source language model (e.g., Llama, Gemma) that generates compilable [Asymptote](https://asymptote.sourceforge.io/) code from technical or mathematical images. This project simulates a real-world application for AI-assisted mathematical content creation in K-12 education.

## **Assignment Components**

### **1\. Model Selection**

* **Task:** Choose an appropriate open-source language model as your base.  
* **Considerations:** Assess model performance, community support, and compatibility with your intended fine-tuning objectives.

### **2\. Dataset Creation**

* **Data Curation:** Curate a dataset consisting of image-to-Asymptote code pairs.  
* **Methodology Documentation:** Clearly document your data collection process including:  
  * Data sources  
  * Tools and techniques used  
  * Any ethical or copyright considerations  
* **Dataset Splitting:** Create and document separate training, validation, and test sets to ensure robust model evaluation.

### **3\. Fine-Tuning Pipeline**

* **Approach:** Design a fine-tuning strategy tailored to the selected model.  
* **Implementation:**  
  * Develop the training pipeline  
  * Apply hyperparameter tuning  
  * Monitor and log model performance during training  
* **Documentation:** Detail your training decisions, challenges faced, and rationale for your choices.

### **4\. Evaluation**

* **Metrics Definition:** Implement evaluation metrics to assess:  
  * **Syntactic Correctness:** The generated Asymptote code must compile without errors.  
  * **Visual Fidelity:** The output diagrams should accurately represent the input images.  
* **Performance Analysis:** Analyze model outputs to determine where the model excels and where improvements are needed.

## **Deliverables**

* **Public GitHub Repository:** Include reproducible code and clear instructions.  
* **Model Access:** Provide trained model weights or an access method.  
* **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation covering:  
  * Data collection methodology  
  * Fine-tuning pipeline details and hyperparameter tuning decisions  
  * Evaluation metrics and analysis of model performance  
* **Final Report:** A detailed report summarizing:  
  * The approach and methodology  
  * Experimental results and performance metrics  
  * Insights, challenges, and potential future improvements

## **Timeline**

* **Duration:** Complete the assignment within two weeks from the assignment date.  
* **Milestones:** Define intermediate checkpoints to track progress and ensure timely completion.

## **Final Evaluation**

Your model will be assessed on a private test set curated by StarSpark.AI, featuring diverse mathematical diagrams relevant to K-12 education.

## **Evaluation Criteria**

* **Technical Implementation:** Robustness and scalability of your solution.  
* **Data Engineering:** Innovation and thoroughness in the dataset creation process.  
* **Problem Solving:** Creative and effective solutions to encountered challenges.  
* **Code Quality & Documentation:** Readability, maintainability, and clarity of code and supporting documentation.  
* **Model Performance:** Effectiveness based on both syntactic correctness and visual fidelity.  
* **Analytical Insights:** Depth of analysis in your final report regarding model successes and areas for improvement.
